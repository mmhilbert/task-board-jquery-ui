# Kanban Task Board
Challenge 5 - Third-Party APIs Challenge: Task Board. This challenge contains a task board in a kanban style where tasks are filed either into the to do, in progress, or done section. Task cards are also color coded to indicate if the task is near a the deadline (yellow)
, or overdue (red) to help keep better track of urgent tasks. These tasks are draggable and droppable, and can also be deleted once completed.
